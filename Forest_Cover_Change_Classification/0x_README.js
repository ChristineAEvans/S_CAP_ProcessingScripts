// These scripts were orginally created within the scope of a project for the SERVIR CArbon Pilot Project which focused on 15 pilot countries across the SERVIR network. 
//Scripts fall within two catagories: Forest Cover Change Classification and Carbon Stock & Emissions.

// Forest Cover Change Classification README contains information on global, tropical, regional and national datasets used in Cherrington et al. 2024 (preprint) [global analysis] and Evans et al. (in prep) [regional and national analysis]; 
// including date ranges, Google Earth Engine collection, and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of forest change estimates are included in the scipts.
