##
These scripts were orginally created within the scope of a project for the [SERVIR CArbon Pilot (S-CAP) Project](https://s-cap.servirglobal.net/) which focused on 15 pilot countries across the [SERVIR](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/) network. Scripts fall within two catagories: Forest Cover Change Classification and Carbon Stock & Emissions.

Forest Cover Change Classification README contains information on global, tropical, regional and national datasets used in [Cherrington et al. 2024 (preprint)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-1179/) [global analysis] and Evans et al. (in prep) [regional and national analysis]; including date ranges, Google Earth Engine collection, and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of forest change estimates are included in the scripts.

Carbon Stock & Emissions README contains information on global, tropical, and national datasets; including date ranges, source and resampled resolutions and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of estimates are included in the scripts.

Workshop and [Mining](https://github.com/katieailsa/S-CAP_mining_emissions) Scripts provide application examples of the S-CAP project
