These scripts were orginally created within the scope of a project for the SERVIR CArbon Pilot (S-CAP) Project which focused on 15 pilot countries across the SERVIR network. Scripts fall within two catagories: Forest Cover Change Classification and Carbon Stock & Emissions.

Forest Cover Change Classification README contains information on global, tropical, regional and national datasets used in Cherrington et al. 2024 (preprint) [global analysis] and Evans et al. (in prep) [regional and national analysis]; including date ranges, Google Earth Engine collection, and data citations. 
General methodology behind the calculation and generation of forest change estimates are included in the scripts.

Carbon Stock & Emissions README contains information on global, tropical, regional and national datasets used in Cherrington et al. 2024 (preprint) [global analysis] and Evans et al. (in prep) [regional and national analysis]; 
Including date ranges, source and resampled resolutions and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of estimates are included in the scripts.

Workshop and Mining Scripts provide application examples of the S-CAP project
