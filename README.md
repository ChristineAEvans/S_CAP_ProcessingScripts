## Description
These scripts were orginally created within the scope of a project for the [SERVIR-CArbon Pilot (S-CAP)](https://s-cap.servirglobal.net/) which focused on 15 pilot countries across the [SERVIR](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/) network. The scripts fall within two catagories:

(i) **forest cover change classification**, and

(ii) **carbon stock & emissions**.

## Additional details
The Forest Cover Change Classification README file contains information on global, tropical, regional and national datasets used in [Cherrington et al. 2024 (preprint)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-1179/) [global analysis] and Evans et al. (in prep) [regional and national analysis]; including date ranges, [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) collection, and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of forest change estimates are included in the scripts.

The Carbon Stock & Emissions README file contains information on global, tropical, and national datasets; including date ranges, source and resampled resolutions and data citations. General methodology behind the calculation and generation of estimates are included in the scripts.

## Mining emissions scripts
The associated [mining scripts repository](https://github.com/katieailsa/S-CAP_mining_emissions) provides additional application examples of S-CAP.
